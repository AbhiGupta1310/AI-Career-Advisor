IXP Intern,SAP,2.9,Bachelor of Technology - BTech,Bengaluru,India,"Based on the candidate profile, acting as a professional compensation analyst in India:

The candidate has 2.9 years of total experience, listed as an ""IXP Intern"" at SAP. While the ""intern"" title might typically suggest a fresher, 2.9 years of experience combined with a strong educational background (B.Tech from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham), extensive and highly relevant skills in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, Generative AI, Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure), and numerous certifications in these areas, indicates a highly skilled individual ready for a junior to mid-level role. The SAP background adds to their profile's strength.

Given the profile type is ML and the location is Bengaluru (a prime tech hub in India with competitive salaries for AI/ML roles), this candidate would be highly sought after for roles such as Associate Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist I, or AI Engineer. They are beyond a typical ""fresher"" salary due to their extensive practical experience, even if much of it was in an internship capacity, and their demonstrated skill set.

Considering all these factors, a realistic and competitive annual salary for this profile in Bengaluru would be:
